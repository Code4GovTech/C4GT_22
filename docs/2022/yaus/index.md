# Project Description
Across sectors, citizens engage with multiple types of links (URLs) on a frequent basis - whether it is students accessing online learning content, unemployed youth sharing resumes with recruiters, government administrators seeking inputs from subordinates through a survey, the list goes on and on. It is important to shorten, customise and track these links for enhanced user centricity and therefore driving usage.


## Project Goal
The end goal is to create a platform like https://branch.io/ for Government
