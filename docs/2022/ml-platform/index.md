# Project Description
While there is a lot of data, itâ€™s not easy to find people who can use that to good effect. The aim of this project is to build a platform that can be used by anyone to train models from these datasets, experiment between different models, deploy the better performing one and monitor the performance in production.

## Project Goals
This project goal is to build an end to end ML-platform to train, serve and deploy models using govtech datasets.
