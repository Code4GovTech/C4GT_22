# Project Description
With the need for GovTech products across states and sectors to scale initiatives, there has been a tremendous jump in the number of tech products that citizens across user personas engage with on a daily basis. Majority of these tech products have a login for authentication and authorization before the user can start engaging with them.

Centralized Accesss Control is an open-source identity provider using Oauth2 reverse-proxy with OpenID Connect provider FusionAuth that enable all GovTech products to not include authentication-related code inside microservices, enabling the creation and management of ACL outside of a microservice in a reusable way.

# Project Goal
1. OAuth Provider Configuration to be added for FusionAuth in OAuth2 Proxy.
2. Help teams/applications get onboarded to the new proxy.
3. Deploy the config in front of the load balancer for all existing services.
