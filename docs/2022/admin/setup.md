### 1. Fork it :fork_and_knife:

You can get your own fork/copy of [admin-generator](https://github.com/Samagra-Development/generator-create-rc-admin) by using the <kbd><b>Fork</b></kbd> button.

### 2. Clone it :busts_in_silhouette:

You need to clone (download) it to a local machine using

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Your_Username/generator-create-rc-admin.git
```

> This makes a local copy of the repository in your machine.

Once you have cloned the `generator-create-rc-admin` repository in GitHub, move to that folder first using the change directory command.

```sh
# This will change directory to a folder generator-create-rc-admin
cd generator-create-rc-admin
```

Move to this folder for all other commands.

### 3. Set it up :arrow_up:

Run the following commands to see that _your local copy_ has a reference to _your forked remote repository_ in GitHub :octocat:

```sh
git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/generator-create-rc-admin.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/generator-create-rc-admin.git (push)
```
